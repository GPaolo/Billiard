This repo contains the Billiard environment for Open\+AI Gym.

It is used to test sparse and deceptive rewards algorithms.

To use it, add it to the folder of the project, then install it by launching the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{setup_8py}{setup.\+py}}} script.

{\bfseries{NB}} The hard version is still a work in progress.
