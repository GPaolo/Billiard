This repo contains the Billiard environment for OpenAI Gym.

It is used to test sparse and deceptive rewards algorithms.

To use it, add it to the folder of the project, then install it by launching the `setup.py` script.

**NB** The hard version is still a work in progress.

## Installation issues
If Box2D fails, first run:

`sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev swig`

and then rerun the setup script
